# draftballs
## Project Description
For fantasy sports leagues, this webapp recreates the excitement of a draft lottery where balls are assigned 
to teams and spun in a hopper for selection of draft order.

## Deliverables
* MVP: 
* must work on GitHub Pages (no server-side capabilities)
* stretch goal: visualization
* super-stretch goal: visualization of actual balls in the hopper

## Procedure
 1. install the demo and make sure it runs on GitHub Pages
 2. spike/POC to see if I can get a simple with state memory for a more robust user experience

## Reflection

### React + Vite

This project built inside the React = Vite template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
